## About The Project

Hi there!

This repo is just a time killer activity for me on my weekend. The design was created by [Muazzim MS](https://www.figma.com/community/file/814055731128774975/Kanban-Board).

Also checkout my design activity on [figma.com/@ardodeardo](https://www.figma.com/@ardodeardo) :v:
